# De-T-Co

A chrome extension to take those annoying t.co links that twitter uses and replace them with the expanded url. No more slow load times just because of Twitter's infrastructure issues and their "short" urls.

## Install

Download the .crx file. In chrome, go to the extensions page (chrome://extensions) and drag the .crx file onto the page.
